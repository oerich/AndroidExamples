(Same as first example during lecture).\r\n\r\n## HelloName\r\n\r\nAdds an EditText and a Button to `HelloAndroid` and lets the user enter his or her name and have it printed on screen. (Same as second example show during lecture).\r\n\r\n## UnitConversion1\r\n\r\nA temperature converter. Shows Spinners and listeners.\r\n\r\n## UnitConversion2\r\n\r\nSame as UnitConversion1 but with support for different types of units (temperature, distance). Introduces ListViews, Intents and how new activities can be started.\r\n\r\n## Calculator\r\n\r\nExample that shows how a listener can differentiate between different buttons and how `onClick` can be replaced with `OnClickListener`. To make things more fun, Calculator is committed in three steps (to simulate a refactoring) where the versions get more and more advanced. The relevant revisions are 9ab37b58025bb03cc23ee3a9016ffda146a1e156 , 6940d15a42210eca61359f90a5122be60f868e69 and 1bc229c9414f9ea6b362f4adadd9f3bde03f115a . \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
