Sample Android projects for DAT255 and EDA397.

## HelloAndroid

Simple example that prints a Hello World message to screen. (Same as first example during lecture).

## HelloName

Adds an EditText and a Button to `HelloAndroid` and lets the user enter his or her name and have it printed on screen. (Same as second example show during lecture).

## UnitConversion1

A temperature converter. Shows Spinners and listeners.

## UnitConversion2

Same as UnitConversion1 but with support for different types of units (temperature, distance). Introduces ListViews, Intents and how new activities can be started.

## Calculator

Based on todays lecture (March 21, 2013) I decided to add another example that shows how a listener can differentiate between different buttons and how `onClick` can be replaced with `OnClickListener`. To make things more fun, Calculator is committed in three steps (to simulate a refactoring) where the versions get more and more advanced. The relevant revisions are 9ab37b58025bb03cc23ee3a9016ffda146a1e156 , 6940d15a42210eca61359f90a5122be60f868e69 and 1bc229c9414f9ea6b362f4adadd9f3bde03f115a .
